### Validator Testing 

- JavaScript
  - No errors were returned when passing through the [JShint validator](https://jshint.com/)

![JS Validate](docs/readme_images/JSvalidate.png)

- CSS
    - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org)

![CSS Validate](docs/readme_images/CSSValidate.png)


- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)

![HTML Validate](docs/readme_images/htmlValidate.png)


### Unfixed errors
* UI Issue
    * There is a slight UI issue on laptop and smaller screens on the easy page when the hint container is pressed.
    * If the hint container is pressed and an option is selected without closing the hint, the hint automatically closes by itself but the next round if the user clicks the hint button again the body shrinks to where a small gray footer appears - meaning the html background acts as a footer.
    * However, this automatically fixes if the user presses the hint button again.

![UI Fault](docs/readme_images/UIFault.png) 

* UI Issue
    * on laptop screens there is also a slight grey footer much smaller than the footer above for the easy quiz.

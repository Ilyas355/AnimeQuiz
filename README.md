### Tools Testing

* [Microsoft Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/overview)

    - Microsoft Edge dev tools was used during the development process to test, explore and modify HTML elements and CSS styles used in the project.

* Responsiveness

    - [Microsoft Edge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/overview) was used to check responsivity throughout the project.
 
* Accesibility
    - [Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) was used for generating the lighthouse report and further reccomended documentation was utilised to increase the score.



### Accessibility
[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs
- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html)
- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user
- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions
- All not textual content had alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers
- HTML page lang attribute has been set
- Aria properties have been implemented correctly
- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed

Manual tests were also performed to ensure the website was accessible as possible and an accessibility issue was identified.
